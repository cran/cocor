ChangeLog for package cocor

changes in version 1.1-2 (2015-10-17)
changed:
  - Fixed hypothesis interpretation error that occured when testing one-sided
    ('less') using confidence intervals
  - Fixed typographical errors in documentation

changes in version 1.1-1 (2015-04-10)
changed:
  - Fixed exclusion of missing data: na.action is now only performed on
    variables that are used to calculate the correlations.
  - Fixed typographical error in documentation of Zou's (2007) confidence
    intervals
  - Changed citation information
added:
  - Added parameter validation for the return.htest parameter.

changes in version 1.1-0 (2015-01-07)
added:
  - Added the difference between the two correlations that were compared to
    the result object and the output.
  - If the correlations are based on two data sets, display the names of both
    data sets in the output.
  - For each of the two correlations that were compared, display the names of
    the variables in the output.
  - Display error message if arguments of the functions cocor.indep.groups(),
    cocor.dep.groups.overlap(), and cocor.dep.groups.nonoverlap() are NA.
changed:
  - Added 'na.action' argument to handle missing data in the cocor() function
    (similar to the cor.test() function) instead of passing the 'use'
    argument to the cor() function.

changes in version 1.0-0 (2013-08-01)
added:
  - Added the function cocor() which calculates and compares correlations
    from raw data.
  - Added the argument conf.level to the functions cocor(),
    cocor.indep.groups(), cocor.dep.groups.overlap(), and cocor.dep.groups.nonoverlap() to
    define the level of confidence for the confidence interval.
  - Added the argument null.value to the functions cocor(),
    cocor.indep.groups(), cocor.dep.groups.overlap(), and cocor.dep.groups.nonoverlap() to test
    whether the difference between the correlations exceeds a given threshold.
  - Added the function as.htest() to convert the cocor result classes to a
    list of class 'htest'.
  - Added the argument return.htest to the functions cocor(),
    cocor.indep.groups(), cocor.dep.groups.overlap(), and cocor.dep.groups.nonoverlap() to
    return the results as a list of class 'htest'.
  - Added the argument data.name to the functions cocor.indep.groups(),
    cocor.dep.groups.overlap(), and cocor.dep.groups.nonoverlap() to specify a name
    that describes the data.
  - Added the argument var.labels to the functions cocor.indep.groups(),
    cocor.dep.groups.overlap(), and cocor.dep.groups.nonoverlap() to add labels to
    the variables j, k, h, and m.
  - Added the data set 'aptitude'.
