#' Statistical tests for the comparison between two correlations based on either independent or dependent groups. Dependent correlations can either be overlapping or nonoverlapping. A web interface is available on the website http://comparingcorrelations.org. A plugin for the R GUI and IDE RKWard is included. Please install RKWard from https://rkward.kde.org to use this feature. The respective R package 'rkward' cannot be installed directly from a repository, as it is a part of RKWard.
